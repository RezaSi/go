## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to deal with channels and select in Go.

## Learning objectives

- understand what channels are
- the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels
- closing channels
- for loop over a channel: for x := range ch { ... }
- use select to receive from several channels

## Concepts

- `channels`

## Prerequisites

- `functions`
- `for-loops`
- `range-iteration`
Additionally, it can be assumed the student already knows goroutines.
